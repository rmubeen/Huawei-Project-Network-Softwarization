What are these:
  vn Location Constraint
  vn Adjancy List
  vLink Order
  vn Path Degree to Next vLinks: look ahead

Doubts about Converter Intance:

Reach Table:
  get all sum sum_combinations
  get all permutations
  get best tuple


Algorithm:
  Read DATA
  For each vlink:
    Find solution:
      For each valid bit_rate:
        For each valid split:
          For each path:
            Find solution for base/advance case
    Update Path slices


-----> ADD: Add Adjency List Prop
-----> ADD: Dynamic Table
New Algo:
  For each vlink:
    For every Pps:
.      Compute all need permutations:
      For every permutation:
        Divide permutation
        Merge permutation
        Compute all q permutations
        For every q permutation:
---->          Find ordered protected paths
---->          For every order
          Find feasible solution
          break if solution found

Delete print base functions.
